lsh-filter
==========

a pure python locality senstive hashing implementation

## Installation
`lsh-filter` is packaged with setuptools so it can be easily installed with pip like this:

````
$ cd lsh-filter/
$ [sudo] pip install -e .
````

## Usage
```python

from lsh_filter import LSHCache

cache = LSHCache()
    
docs = [
  "lipstick on a pig",
  "you can put lipstick on a pig",
  "you    can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig",
  "you can put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig",
  "i think they put some lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig",
  "putting lipstick on a pig",
  "you know you can put lipstick on a pig",
  "they were going to send us binders full of women",
  "they were going to send us binders of women",
  "a b c d e f",
  "a b c d f"]

dups = {}
for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
    dups[i] = cache.insert(doc.split(), i)
    ...
````

## Tools

`analyze_lsh` will generate a model set of documents and run lsh over it.  It will generate statistics
showing how many documents a cache will return based on the measured similarity of the documents. e.g.,

````
$ python scripts/analyze_lsh.py --doc-len 1 10 --num-tokens 10 --similarity jaccard

## Roadmap
* add more tests
* add `save()` and `from_file()` methods
* rewrite with redis backend?
